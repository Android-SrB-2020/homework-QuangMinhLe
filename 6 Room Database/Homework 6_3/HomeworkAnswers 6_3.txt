1.In the ViewModel, define the LiveData value gotoBlueFragment.
  In the RedFragment, observe the gotoBlueFragment value. Implement the observe{} code to navigate to BlueFragment when appropriate, and then reset the value of gotoBlueFragment to indicate that navigation is complete.
  Make sure your code sets the gotoBlueFragment variable to the value that triggers navigation whenever the app needs to go from RedFragment to BlueFragment.
