1. They are non-blocking
   They run asynchronously.
   They can be run on a thread other than the main thread.
   They always make app runs faster.
   They can be written and read as linear code. 
2. An ordinary function annotated with the suspend keyword.
   A function that can be called inside coroutines.
   Suspend functions must always run in the background. 
3. When execution is blocked, no other work can be executed on the blocked thread.
   When execution is suspended, the thread can do other work while waiting for the offloaded work to complete.
   Suspending is more efficient, because threads may not be waiting, doing nothing.
